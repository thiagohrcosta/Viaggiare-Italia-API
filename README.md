The backend in this repository was developed to supply the data that is consumed by the [frontend (see here)](https://github.com/thiagohrcosta/Viaggiare-Italia)

# Technologies

-[\[Nokogiri\]](https://nokogiri.org/):  Using Nokogiri's features, it was possible to quickly develop a complete seed based on data scraped from real sites. Restaurant names, cities, photos, were quickly entered into the database using real data scrapping.
- City names was scraped from: https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-cities-and-towns-in-Italy-2047404
- Restaurants names was scraped from: https://www.forketers.com/120-italian-restaurant-names-will-amaze-even-italians/
- Images was scraped from: https://unsplash.com/collections/K4_v8gc61jw/italianbanner and https://unsplash.com/collections/9FKBTb41_jU/italian

Using Nokogiri to scrape data at this time allowed, for example, to automatically insert 308 Italian cities with a simple scraping code.
